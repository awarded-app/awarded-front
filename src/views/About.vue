    <h2 class="mb-8">What is this?</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        I started <span class="text-white">Awarded</span> as a present for my dear
        <span class="text-white">mom</span>. Every year we would sit together through movie sessions
        where we would watch all nominated movies for the <span class="text-white">Oscars</span>, or
        the winner movies of <span class="text-white">Cannes</span> or
        <span class="text-white">Berlinale</span> Festivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        She would keep track of all movies in a little
        <span class="text-white">list</span>, and tick one by one as we watched them. Sometimes we
        missed one or two, or the list would get lost among the house's papers and she would start
        it all over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then had the idea to do this for her. A place where she could find
        <span class="text-white">all nominations, for all awards, for all years</span>. Easy, fast,
        always available. There was also the potential this could be useful for many people. So I
        got on building.
      </p>
      <h3>What's the vision?</h3>
      <p>
        What you see here is still a work in progress. The idea is to expand not only adding more
        awards and movies, but also
        <span class="text-white">books, games, products, buildings, TV shows</span>; anything that
        was nominated or got a prize has the potential to come to Awarded.
      </p>
      <h3>How to get updates?</h3>
      <p>
        To get (very occasional) updates about new categories or when the latest nominations are
        online,
